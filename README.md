# Harder Easy-death

Can be found [here](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/harder-easy-death).

This mod makes the player lose one item when playing in Easy mode by default.

You can configure the amount of items lost with [Extra Settings API](https://www.raftmodding.com/mods/extra-settings-api).
There is also a setting that will make it behave like Normal mode (lose some items in a stack and damage tools).
